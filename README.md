# Picycle
A library represent images in an epicyclic way


# How is it used

First, make sure you use conda and create a virtual enviroment with your preferred name:


```
conda create -n epicycle python==3.6
```

After creating the enviroment, install ffmpeg library using conda:

```
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
```

Now, just download the library I have created:

```
pip install photoepicycle

```

Now, just clone the repository above (assuming you have git installed):

```
git clone .....

```

You are all set! Navigate to the folder where the epicycle.py is located and run it:

```
python epicycle.py -p path/to/your/picture
```

Just wait, and a video will emerge showing an epicyclic representation of the image.
